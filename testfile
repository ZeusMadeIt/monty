The Doctor and the Woman
Rhyming Couplet Ideas by shishi
See the moving of the doctor,
I think he's angry at the dockter.

He finds it hard to see the car,
Overshadowed by the small dinar.

Who is that dancing near the house?
I think she'd like to eat the mickey mouse.

She is but a blue woman,
Admired as she sits upon a policewoman.

Her purple car is just a cheese,
It needs no gas, it runs on pleas.
